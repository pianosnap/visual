# midee vs SeeMusic: honest comparison

SeeMusic is one of the best-known MIDI visualizers among music educators and serious piano YouTubers. It's a paid, native desktop app for Windows and macOS, made by Visual Musical Minds. If you've found your way here, you're probably wondering:

- "Do I actually need to pay for SeeMusic, or is there a free version that's good enough?"
- "Can I do this in a browser instead of installing another desktop app?"

**[midee](/)** is the free, browser-native option. This page walks through what SeeMusic does well, where midee fits, and how to pick between them.

## Quick comparison

| Live MIDI controller input | Yes | Yes |
| Loop station with bar-snapped layering | No | **Yes** |
| Session recording / `.mid` bounce | Limited | Yes |
| Visual themes | Yes, extensive | Yes, five themes + particle styles |
| Runs on Linux / Chromebook | No | Yes |
| Your files leave your device? | Depends on tier | No - fully client-side |

## Where SeeMusic wins

SeeMusic has been in the space for years and has features midee doesn't:

- **Custom skins and animations.** SeeMusic's visual library is deep. You can pick from dozens of pre-made styles, configure particle density, camera motion, etc.
- **Professional polish for teachers.** The score display, fingering, and note-label options are tuned for classroom use.
- **Precise video rendering pipeline.** SeeMusic's native rendering uses the full capability of the GPU and handles complex scenes at high resolution smoothly.
- **Multi-track mixing controls.** Per-track volume, pan, and solo controls for arrangements.

If you're a teacher making polished demonstration videos daily or a full-time music YouTuber who needs every frame under control, SeeMusic is a mature, battle-tested tool worth the license.

## Where midee fits

midee is the browser-first, design-forward, open-source option for everyone who doesn't need the full SeeMusic kit.

- **No install, no license key.** Open [midee.app](/), drag in a `.mid`, and you're rendering. Works on Chromebooks, locked-down work laptops, Linux - anywhere SeeMusic doesn't run.
- **No watermark, ever.** midee's MP4 export is clean on the free tier because there *is* no paid tier.
- **Fully client-side.** Your MIDI file and the rendered video never leave your browser.
- **Vertical export out of the box.** TikTok/Reels 9:16, square 1:1, 1080p, 720p, or native aspect ratio - all free, all built-in.
- **Loop station + live play.** Jam with a MIDI controller, loop a phrase bar-snapped to the metronome, layer takes, record sessions. This is the one category where midee does something SeeMusic doesn't.
- **Open source.** The [source is on GitHub](https://github.com/aayushdutt/midee). Fork it, submit themes and particle styles, audit the code.

## When to pick which

Use **SeeMusic** if:

- You render 20 videos a month and need every visual parameter tuned precisely.
- You're already on Windows or macOS and a paid license is fine with you.
- You need features midee doesn't yet have: score overlay with fingering, per-instrument animated characters, very specific camera cinematography.

Use **midee** if:

- You want to render a nice-looking piano-roll video for Reels / TikTok / YouTube without paying or installing anything.
- You're on Linux, a Chromebook, or any platform SeeMusic doesn't support.
- You prefer open-source tools.
- You want to jam on your MIDI keyboard and record loops *alongside* the visualizer, not in a separate DAW.
- You want "drop and go" - try it, render it, share it, without commitment.

## Common questions

**Is midee's video quality comparable to SeeMusic's?**
For most use cases, yes. midee renders at 60fps with baked-in audio, frame-accurate via WebCodecs. The output is plain H.264 MP4 that uploads to YouTube, TikTok, and Reels without any re-encoding on their side. The aesthetic is different - midee leans clean and design-forward; SeeMusic leans cinematic with more camera motion options - so pick the look you prefer.

**Does midee require internet?**
Only on first load. Once the app is cached, MIDI playback and video export work offline.

**Will midee eventually charge?**
No plans to. The project is open source, indie, and built because existing options demanded money, uploads, or installs. If features land that need server costs (hosted galleries, collaborative features), those will be opt-in and priced separately, and the core visualizer + export will stay free.

**Can I install midee as a desktop app?**
Yes - modern browsers let you "Install" a web app from the URL bar. It runs in its own window, pinnable in the dock. midee ships a web manifest so this works cleanly.

## Try it

Trying SeeMusic means downloading ~500 MB and creating an account. Trying midee is one click. [Open it](/), drop in a `.mid`, and see if it earns a place in your workflow.
