// convenience wrapper) so we can schedule `rawContext.suspend(t)` checkpoints
// and emit real progress updates. The native `OfflineAudioContext.suspend()`
// API pauses the render at a specified render-time point and yields back to
// the main thread; we report progress, then `resume()` to continue.
