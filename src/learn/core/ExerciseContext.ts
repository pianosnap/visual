// `learnState`, `progress`, and `overlay` are Learn-mode-owned and live on
// the context itself so the controller can wire them without bloating the
// global AppServices bag.
//
// `log` and `storage` are scoped to the current exercise id so an exercise
// can't accidentally read/write another's data. The runner builds the
// scoped wrappers when it instantiates the exercise.
